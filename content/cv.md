## Professional Summary

Experience in **performance engineering and algorithms** across the stack:

- implemented & maintain the integer linear programming (ILP) solver in MLIR [[code sample]](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/mlir/lib/Analysis/Presburger/Simplex.cpp#L1996) [[library]](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/mlir/lib/Analysis/Presburger)
- optimized an ILP solver for compiler workloads using C++ templates & AVX-512 vector intrinsics to achieve a **3.6x speedup over SOTA** [[Distinguished Paper at OOPSLA]](https://2021.splashcon.org/details/splash-2021-oopsla/66/FPL-Fast-Presburger-Arithmetic-through-Transprecision)

### Student Researcher at Google DeepMind (Paris)
**November 2023 — February 2024**

Worked on static analysis for tiled linear algebraic kernels. I developed asymptotically faster algorithms for ILP for subclasses relevant to compilers, with proofs of efficiency & correctness. [[Paper @ CAV]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-65627-9_14)
